\arguments{
\item{t}{temporary numeric value, the current time step.}

\item{cr}{temporary numeric value, the current control rule.}

\item{NM}{numeric value, the total number of natural mortality estimates.}

\item{fdr}{temporary numeric value, the current final target density ratio.}

\item{Rec_age}{numeric value, the age at recruitment, in years.}

\item{Max_age}{numeric value, the maximum age or total lifespan, in years.}

\item{SSB}{numeric array,  the spawning stock biomass of the whole stock for
each area, at each timestep, under each control rule, and for each
estimate of natural mortality.}

\item{N}{numeric array, the number of individuals at each age, in each
area, at each timestep, under each control rule, and for each estimate of
natural mortality.}

\item{W}{numeric vector, the estimated weight at age from age at recruitment
to maximum age, in kg.}

\item{Mat}{numeric vector, the estimated fraction of individuals mature at
each age, from age at recruitment to maximum age, on the interval (0, 1).}

\item{A}{numeric value, the number of total areas in the model. Default
value is 5.}

\item{Fb}{numeric value, the historical fishing effort for the fished species.}

\item{E}{numeric array, the relative fishing effort displayed in each area,
at each time step, under each control rule, and for each natural mortality
estimate.}

\item{S}{numeric vector, the selectivities at age from age at recruitment to
maximum age, on the interval (0, 1).}

\item{FM}{numeric array that corresponds to the fishing mortality at each
age in each area, at each timestep, under all control rules, with all
estimates of natural mortality.}

\item{A50_mat}{numeric value, the first age at which 50\% or more individuals
are estimated to be mature. on the interval (Rec_age, Max_age).}

\item{Biomass}{numeric array, the total biomass in each area, at each time
step, under all control rules, with all estimates of natural mortality,
in kg.}

\item{Abundance}{numeric array, the total number of all and/or mature
individuals in each area, at each timestep, under all control rules, with
all estimates of natural mortality.}

\item{Fishing}{logical value, is fishing occurring? Default value is TRUE.}

\item{Nat_mortality}{numeric vector, the estimates of natural mortality.}

\item{R}{numeric vector, the estimated recruits coming into each area at the
current time step, under the current control rule, and with the current
estimate of natural mortality.}

\item{Ind_sampled}{character value, the individuals to be sampled to
calculate density ratio. Values can be:
'all' - sample all individuals.
'mature' - sample only mature individuals.
Default value is 'all'.}

\value{
numeric arrays, with updated values of fishing mortality (FM),
   numbers at age (N), Abundance, Biomass, and spawning stock biomass (SSB).
}
\description{
\code{pop_dynamics} returns updated values for fishing mortality, numbers at
   age, abundance of all and mature individuals, biomass, and spawning stock
   biomass in a specific area, at a specific time step, under a specific
   control rule, and with a specific estimate of natural mortality
