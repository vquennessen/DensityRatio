Description: This package runs an age-structured single-sex model to explore the 
   effects of different control rules on fished stock yield, biomass, and 
   spawning stock biomass. The model can be edited to run for different fished 
   species, with different proportions of areas in reserves, different ways to 
   allocate fishing effort, for different recruitment styles, and for different 
   timespans. Control rules specifically can be edited to have different target 
   density ratios (for explanation of density ratios, see Babcock & MacCall 
   2011).
